# Dynamics_Mechanical_Systems
Project from the course of Dynamics of Mechanical Systems at PoliMi. This work explores advanced topics in the dynamics and vibrations of mechanical systems, focusing on multi-degree-of-freedom systems and distributed parameter systems. It covers the derivation and solution of equations of motion for free and forced vibrations, damping effects, and introduces beam-type distributed systems under small displacement assumptions. The project also delves into discretization techniques such as mode superposition and the Finite Element Method.
