# Dynamics_Mechanical_Systems
Projects from the course of Dynamics of Mechanical Systems at PoliMi. The Bike project involves implementing the Finite Element Method to model and analyze the structural behavior of a bicycle frame under various loading conditions. This includes discretizing the frame into finite elements, applying appropriate boundary conditions, and interpreting the results to assess structural integrity. The Hovenring project applies FEM and modal analysis techniques to a continuous system, specifically analyzing the dynamic behavior of a bridge-like structure.
